# Catan randomizer

This project was created during the Individual Hack Day at the </salt> bootcamp — inspired by my love for the board game Catan.


## What It Does

Tired of playing on the same old Catan map? This tool generates a brand new, randomized map for each game — making sure every session feels fresh and exciting. Whether you're a seasoned Settler or just getting into the game, this randomizer helps keep things unpredictable and fun.
